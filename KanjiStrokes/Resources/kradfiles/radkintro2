# Radkfile - 2 is built as required from the Kradfile -2 source file, and is
# in the same format as the original JIS X 0208 Radkfile.
#
# Kradfile - 2 was created by James Rose by means of analysis of
# all 5,801 JIS X 0212 Kanji and identification of the constituent
# radicals and other common elements, with the goal of extending the
# capability of current kanji selection by-multi-radical tools in this range.
# Care has been exercised to maintain the same format as the original
# kradfile by Michael Raine and Jim Breen to aid in integration with
# existing electronic dictionary programs.
#
# Two fonts were used in decomposition so as to include as many glyphs as
# possible.  One apparently based on the JIS X 0212 standard itself, and
# one based on Unicode.  Each JIS X 0212 kanji is represented by 3 bytes
# in EUC-JP encoding, as opposed to the two bytes used in the JIS X 0208
# range, so adjust your software accordingly if necessary.
#
# The useable portion of the file consists of 5,801 lines; one for each of the
# JIS X 0212 kanji. Each line is a follows:
# - the kanji itself,
# - a space followed by a colon (:) followed by a space,
# - one or more radicals/elements which can be seen in the kanji. These
#   are drawn from JIS X 0208-1997. Where the element alone is not in
#   JIS X 0208, a kanji which contains the element is used instead.
#
# The decomposition is based on what can be seen in typical kanji
# glyphs. Elements themselves can be further subdivided.
