# This is the data file that drives the multi-radical lookup method in XJDIC,
# WWWJDIC and possibly other dictionary and related software.
# 
# The file is based on work done in 1994/1995 by Michael Raine in which he
# analyzed all the JIS1/2 kanji and identified the constituent radicals and 
# other common elements, with the intention of facilitating the selection of
# kanji within a dictionary program by identifying multiple elements.
# The file was revised by Jim Breen in September 1995. Further revisions were
# done in 1998/9 at the suggestion of Wolfgang Conrath, then a revision was
# carried out in 2001 using suggestions from Yutaka Ohno based on a similar
# decomposition made by Kobayashi. Further amendments were made in July
# 2001 after suggestions from Hendrik.
#
# The file has been modified on numerous occasions. See the header on the
# "kradfile" for some details of these.
# 
# The format of the file is as follows:
# 
# (a) all lines starting with a # are comments
# (b) all lines starting with a $ identify a kanji element, followed by its
# stroke-count and optionally either the JIS X 0212 code of the kanji 
# whose glyph better depicts the element in question or the name of an image
# file (used by the WWWJDIC server).
# (c) all other lines with kanji in them are associated with the previously
# identified element.
# 
# The file can, of course, be modified by users to suit their preferences.
# Note that this file has been automatically compiled from another file,
# "kradfile", in which each of the JIS1/2 kanji is listed, along with its
# elements.
